# research-plans

A Claude Code plugin for plan-based research workflows in the social sciences.

The idea is simple. A research project keeps two kinds of plans. A **master plan** is a lightweight roadmap: what the components of the project are, what state each one is in, and where its plan lives. An **execution plan** is a focused, written plan for one component (data cleaning, one analysis, a simulation), co-authored with the AI, signed by the researcher, and revised in tracked versions when execution teaches you something. A separate **decision log** records researcher and AI decisions as they happen. The AI carries the bookkeeping so the researcher can think about the research.

Plans are organized around the research project and its questions. The master plan carries numbered research questions (RQ1, RQ2, ...) and every component names which questions it serves. Components are research activities, never a history of what happened in the repository.

This turns AI assistance into something inspectable. The plan says what the work will do, why, and how you will judge whether it succeeded. The version history shows how your thinking changed. The log shows who decided what. A coauthor or reviewer can read all three.

## Install

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add letitbk/research-plans
/plugin install research-plans@research-plans
```

Then restart Claude Code. See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for a walkthrough.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/research-plans:init` | Opt a project in. Interview, seed the components list, create the artifacts. |
| `/research-plans:adopt` | Retrospectively decompose already-done work into components, each with a full retrospective plan (reviewed in one board batch); reconstruct pre-adoption history. |
| `/research-plans:renew` | Change the project's direction: archive the master plan, write a fresh one over the existing work. Numbering continues, carried components keep their plans and results, the rest stay browsable in the archive. Preferred over adopt when starting the workflow in an exploratory repo you want to take somewhere new. |
| `/research-plans:plan` | Scope the next component and co-author its execution plan. |
| `/research-plans:sync` | Post-execution checkpoint. Update the tracker, catch unlogged decisions, version the plan if execution deviated. |
| `/research-plans:review` | Two-stage review: first a pass/fail threshold (is this a plan at all: goal and success criteria, reasoned scope decisions, executable steps, a named verification plan, prospectivity, recorded revisions), then a quality grade if it passes. Always includes a split assessment. |
| `/research-plans:results` | Capture a versioned results bundle for a component — brief report, figure/table snapshots, key numbers, script snapshots, and an automatic plan-vs-execution validation. `--adopt` brings pre-existing artifacts under verification. |
| `/research-plans:report` | Generate a shareable report for a bundle (markdown always; PDF/DOCX via pandoc) into `plans/reports/` — also available as the board's Generate report button. |
| `/research-plans:board` | Open the board: a browser dashboard over everything, with drift flags, live annotation, a shareable snapshot, or `--publish` to a GitHub Pages URL. |

Everything is opt-in. The plugin does nothing in projects you have not initialized.

## The board

The board renders the whole project in your browser, in five views — six after a renewal: the **Tracker** (components as a status board, with drift flags and per-row results badges), the **Plan reader** (any version of any plan, with v1 to v2 diffs and the reason each revision was made), **Results** (see below), the **Timeline** (decisions, plan versions, results captures, verdicts, and reviews in one stream), **Reviews** (saved rubric scorecards), and — when the project has been renewed — an **Archive** view that renders each archived master plan as it was, its component rows still linking to their plans and results. Pre-renewal components carry a quiet badge everywhere instead of drift flags.

The board follows your OS light/dark preference, with a header toggle to override it (exports and shares carry the toggle too). On the Results view, a provenance flow diagram maps each producing script to its artifacts — click a script to read the snapshot line by line (and comment on lines), click an artifact to zoom or jump to its card.

It runs in two modes. **Live**: `/research-plans:board` starts a small local server (python3 only, nothing to install), opens your browser, and waits. Select text in a plan to attach a comment, or leave general comments on any view, then press "Send to Claude" — the feedback lands back in your session, drives plan revisions, and is recorded in the decision log. Or let an agent do the reviewing: the **Review with** button on any plan version, the master plan, or a results bundle runs Codex, Gemini, a Claude subagent, or a three-lens subagent panel and seeds its section-anchored comments onto the board — attributed to the reviewer — for you to curate before they route the same way. **Snapshot**: `/research-plans:board --export` writes a single self-contained `plans/board.html` that anyone can open without Claude Code or an internet connection (figures are inlined). Snapshots are read-only. Treat the file like publishing your plans: it contains everything under `plans/`, including result figures, tables, and script snapshots.

## Results

Plans say what the work will do; results bundles show what it did. `/research-plans:results` captures a **versioned, immutable bundle** per component at `plans/execution/<component>/results/rN/`: a brief agent-drafted report, snapshot copies of the figures and tables (sha256-verified against their sources; files over 5 MB are recorded by path + checksum instead of copied), the exact scripts that produced them, and the key numbers as metric tiles. Capture goes through a staging directory and an atomic rename, so a bundle either exists complete and validated or not at all. Re-running an analysis can never silently change what you verified — a redo is the next `rN`.

Bundles are journal-first (v0.10): the project's CLAUDE.md carries output conventions with a target journal, so analysis deliverables are journal-ready figures (vector PDF + PNG) and typeset tables (a .png render with its .tex source and estimates CSV attached) — a CSV is click-to-open data, never dumped inline on the board. Every planned capture also runs an automatic **validation**: an independent subagent compares the signed plan against the staged scripts, artifacts, and decision log, and its per-step verdict (conforms / conforms-with-amendments / deviations-found) is sealed into the bundle and rendered on the board. Advisory, never a gate — an unrecorded deviation is flagged, and the remedy is a plan revision.

On the board's Results view you review a bundle — report, validation audit, stat tiles, figure/table gallery, and a per-artifact "produced by" script drawer with line-anchored comments — and issue a **verdict**: Accept, or Request changes with comments. A **Generate report** button assembles the bundle into a standalone shareable report (markdown plus PDF/DOCX via pandoc) under `plans/reports/`. The verdict flows back to your session, which records it (`verdict.json`, written once), logs it in the decision log, and marks the tracker `done (verified)` on accept. On request-changes, your comments drive script fixes and a re-run, captured as the next bundle. Verdicts are recorded acts, not gates: nothing blocks the tracker on unverified results, but the board's Tracker flags them.

Adopting the workflow mid-project? `/research-plans:results --adopt` scans your output folders, lets you pick which existing figures/tables matter, and files them as bundles marked `retrofit` — honest that no plan governed their production, reviewable and verifiable all the same.

Plans ran ahead of your results record? `/research-plans:results` with **no argument** is reconcile mode: it walks the tracker for components that are done but bundle-less (or whose verified sources have drifted), and backfills them one interview at a time. Work that a signed plan governed but was captured after the fact is marked `late` — the same honesty rule as the decision log's late-captured entries: backfilling is fine, unlabeled backfilling is not.

- **Share with collaborators**: `--share` exports an annotatable board file you can email; collaborators comment in their browser and send back a feedback file that `--collect <file>` routes with attribution.

## The sign-off gate

Signing a plan is enforced, not offered. The plugin ships a PreToolUse hook: whenever Claude tries to write a signed version file (`plans/execution/<component>/vN.md`) in an initialized project, the write is blocked while the proposed plan opens in your browser — rendered, with the diff against the previous version. You either approve (the version is written exactly as shown) or request changes with comments (the write is denied, your feedback goes back to Claude, and the gate reopens on the next attempt). The same hook mechanically enforces immutability: edits to or overwrites of an existing signed version are always denied.

Scope and honesty: the gate covers Claude's file tools (Write and Edit). Shell redirection is not interceptable; the immutability convention and the review's revisability check cover after-the-fact edits. The gate only ever activates in projects that opted in (both markers present). For headless or CI work, set `RESEARCH_PLANS_NO_GATE=1` — the bypass leaves a visible trace in the transcript. The wait ceiling is 25 minutes (`RESEARCH_PLANS_GATE_TIMEOUT`, clamped); an unanswered gate denies safely.

The same hook also enforces **results-bundle immutability**: writes inside an existing `results/rN/` are denied (the one exception is one-time creation of `verdict.json`). This branch is pure file policy — it never opens a browser, so results capture can't deadlock on it. There is deliberately no verdict gate.

```

Plus a short marked section in your project's `CLAUDE.md` so every future session follows the conventions. Unsigned working drafts (`.draft-vN.md`), results staging directories (`.staging-*`), and board bookkeeping files are gitignored automatically.

## Principles

- Plans are written before the work and govern it. A plan is a contract with a built-in amendment process, not a preregistration: a recorded revision is an amendment, legitimate and expected; only a silent deviation is a breach.
- Plan versions are immutable. Revisions are new files that say what changed and why.
- The decision log is written as decisions happen, never backfilled.
- The researcher decides and signs. The AI asks, drafts, and keeps the books.

The workflow comes out of a methods paper on plan-based human-AI research partnerships (reference to follow). The quality rubric bundled with the plugin (`skills/managing-research-plans/references/plan-rubric.md`) is a working draft.

## Developing the board

The board UI is a React app in `board/`, built once into a single committed HTML template at `skills/managing-research-plans/assets/board-template.html`. Researchers never need node; `board.py` only injects data into the prebuilt template. To change the UI:

```
cd board
npm install
npm run dev      # develop against sample data
npm test         # contract-parser tests (drift alarm for the artifact formats)
npm run build    # regenerates the committed template
```

If you change any artifact format (templates or the commands that write them), the parser tests in `board/src/lib/parse.test.ts` are the alarm that the board needs updating.
