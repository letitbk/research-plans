Reconcile the plan artifacts with what actually happened. Skill context: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/SKILL.md`. Requires an initialized project (`plans/master-plan.md` with its marker); if absent, say so and stop.

1. **Gather the evidence.** What happened this session (your own context), plus `git log`/`git diff` since the last sync or plan commit, plus outputs on disk. **No-git fallback:** if this is not a git repository, rely on session context and files only, and say that git evidence was unavailable. **Adoption cutoff:** the master plan's `Initialized:` timestamp (git first-commit of master-plan.md when the line is absent) bounds everything below — work and decisions from before it are never loggable in the decision log and never count as deviations, since no plan governed them (pre-adoption decisions are recordable instead in `plans/history.md` — a reconstructed record, not the real-time log — via `/research-plans:adopt`). This matters especially when the workflow was adopted mid-session: only the post-adoption part of the session is in scope.

2. **Compare against the plan.** Read the latest `vN.md` for each component touched. Classify what happened: within plan / minor divergence / material deviation (a Scope decision changed, a build step was replaced, verification differed, new work outside Out of scope).

3. **Update the tracker.** For each touched component: status change only with evidence (outputs, commits), one-line outcome note (one line — detail lives elsewhere), refresh `Last updated:`.

4. **Late-capture protocol for the decision log.** List the decision points you can identify from this session that were never logged. **Ask the researcher to confirm each one** — do not reconstruct silently, and never infer decisions from git alone. Append only confirmed items, each explicitly labeled, e.g.:

   `## 2026-07-02 16:40 (late-captured at sync)`

   Entries keep the standard Context / Question / Response / Effect format. Never write a late capture as if it had been logged in real time, and never touch existing entries. Decisions from *earlier* sessions within the governed period stay unlogged — note the gap to the researcher instead of backfilling it. A missed decision that predates the `Initialized:` cutoff is not a log gap at all: offer to record it in `plans/history.md` (`/research-plans:adopt`'s history pass) — a reconstructed record with date-granularity and cited evidence, never a backdated log entry.

5. **Split flag.** If execution revealed the component has become multi-component (per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/references/split-criteria.md`), say so and propose the split as tracker rows.

6. **Version on material deviation.** A recorded revision is an **amendment** to the plan; a silent deviation is a **breach** — that is why material deviation gets a new signed version rather than a quiet continuation. If step 2 found material deviation, write the proposed revision to `plans/execution/<NN-slug>/.draft-v<N+1>.md` (resume an existing draft rather than overwriting it): copy the current version, apply the changes, add the `Supersedes: vN — <what changed and why>` line — the amendment record: trigger + change. Walk the researcher through the diff — a board preview (`/research-plans:board <NN-slug>`) is available, but **formal approval happens at the sign-off gate**: writing `v<N+1>.md` automatically opens the proposed version in the researcher's browser for approve/request-changes. Before writing, make sure any preview board session has been submitted or closed — the gate needs the board. Add the sign-off line, then write `v<N+1>.md` (**overwrite guard:** compute the next unused version number; the gate also enforces this mechanically). If the gate denies, read `plans/.board-feedback.md`, revise the draft, and write again. After approval lands, delete the draft. `vN.md` is never edited — not even typos (the gate blocks such edits).

7. **Offer results capture.** For each component whose status moved to `done` this sync — or where `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/scripts/results.py changed --component <NN-slug>` reports drifted sources — offer `/research-plans:results <component>`. If several components need capture, offer `/research-plans:results` with no argument instead — its reconcile mode walks them one by one. Never capture silently; the researcher decides. A component with an accepted bundle whose sources have since drifted deserves an explicit flag: the verified results no longer match the code outputs on disk.

8. **Suggest a commit** naming the change, e.g. `plans: sync — 02-analysis done; v2 supersedes v1 (ICC check)` (do not run without approval).
