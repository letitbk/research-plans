Author an execution plan for one component, jointly with the researcher. Skill context: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/SKILL.md`. This command requires an initialized project (`plans/master-plan.md` with its marker); if absent, say so and stop — suggest `/research-plans:init`.

1. **Pick the component.** Read `plans/master-plan.md`, including its `### Research questions` list and the component's `Serves` value — the plan you are about to author is anchored to those questions. If `$ARGUMENTS` names or numbers a component, use it; otherwise propose the first `not started` row (table order is the default sequence) and confirm.

   **Mid-session intake.** If planning follows same-session exploratory work (including mid-session adoption), harvest it: choices already made and their observed reasons become grounded Whys in Scope decisions and content for the Goal section. Do not backfill decision-log entries for pre-plan exploration — the log records the planning dialogue from now on.

2. **Scope check before authoring.** Judge the component against `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/references/split-criteria.md`. If it spans independent parts, propose the split first: new named components as tracker rows, then plan only the one being worked on next.

3. **Offer bounded exploration.** If the component is data-facing and the data has not been explored, offer a short, read-only exploration per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/references/explore-before-planning.md` before authoring. Findings feed the Scope decisions table; surprises go to the decision log.

4. **Co-author through dialogue, not generation.** The FIRST dimension is the goal: what this component will produce or establish, which research question(s) it serves (confirm or correct the tracker's Serves value), and the concrete success criteria the researcher will judge it by — these become the `## Goal and success criteria` section with its `Serves:` line, and every build step must trace back to them. Then work dimension by dimension through the substantive choices (sample, measures, model or method, robustness, outputs — whatever fits the component), using AskUserQuestion. For each choice:
   - present the live options with trade-offs,
   - **require a reason** — the Why column is the point of the artifact,
   - **push back on pure agent defaults**: if the researcher waves a choice through, say what the default assumes and ask if that assumption holds here. Draw the researcher's knowledge out; do not substitute your own.
   - Append decision-log entries **as the dialogue happens** (real timestamps via `date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"`), not afterward.

5. **Write the plan.** Determine `NN` (next number in `plans/execution/`) and a short slug. **Overwrite guard:** the target is `plans/execution/<NN-slug>/v1.md`; if that file already exists, stop and ask — never overwrite any `vN.md`. Fill the template at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/templates/execution-plan.md`: all eight sections, Goal and success criteria first (Files to reuse only if real), no Supersedes line for v1, researcher's choices and reasons in the Scope decisions table. What goes in: the choices and their reasons. What stays out: speculation about results, agent boilerplate.

6. **Sign-off.** Read the finished draft back in brief. Offer a board review first: write the drafted plan to `plans/execution/<NN-slug>/.draft-v1.md` (resume an existing draft rather than overwriting it) and run `/research-plans:board <NN-slug>` so the researcher can read it rendered and annotate; fold their annotations into the draft. This is an offer — if declined, proceed directly. On the researcher's approval, add the sign-off line with their name and today's date, write `v1.md`, delete the draft file if one exists, update the component's tracker row to `planned` with a link to the plan, and update `Last updated:`.

7. **Suggest a commit** such as `plan: <NN-slug> v1` (do not run without approval).
