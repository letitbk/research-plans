Open the project board, or export a shareable snapshot. Skill context: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/SKILL.md`. The board script is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/scripts/board.py`; it needs only python3.

1. **Gate.** Requires `plans/master-plan.md` with its marker; if absent, say so and suggest `/research-plans:init`. Stop.

2. **Recover pending feedback first.** If `plans/.board-feedback.md` exists, a previous board session was interrupted before its feedback was routed. Run `python3 <script> --collect`, route what it prints (step 5), and only then consider opening a new board.

3. **Resolve the mode.** If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--export`, go to step 7. If it contains `--share`, go to step 8. If it contains `--collect` with a file path, go to step 9. If it names a component (name or number), resolve it to its `NN-slug` from the master plan for `--focus`.

4. **Serve.** Run exactly:
   `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/scripts/board.py [--focus NN-slug]`
   **in the background** if the harness supports background bash (completion re-invokes you with its output); otherwise run it in the foreground with a 10-minute timeout. Tell the researcher: the board is open in their browser; annotate, then press "Send to Claude". Handle the exit:
   - **exit 0** — the feedback document is on stdout; go to step 5.
   - **exit 2** (timed out, no feedback) — tell the researcher to finish annotating and run `/research-plans:board` again; step 2 will recover their submission via the pending file.
   - **exit 130** (cancelled) — stop quietly.
   - **exit 1 with "another board is open"** — relay the message; the researcher closes the other board or asks you to re-run with `--force`.
   - If the bash call itself timed out or its output is lost, run `--collect` to retrieve the feedback.

5. **Route the feedback.** Parse the ```json board-feedback``` fence in the document (fall back to the markdown if the fence is missing or corrupt). Then:
   - **Anchored comments on a signed vN**: discuss each with the researcher. If they approve changes, write or refine `plans/execution/<NN-slug>/.draft-v<N+1>.md` — resume an existing draft rather than overwriting it; copy the current version, apply the changes, add the `Supersedes: vN — <reason>` line. Offer the board again so they can review the vN↔draft diff. Only on their sign-off write `v<N+1>.md` (overwrite guard: next unused number), add the sign-off line, and delete the draft. Never edit a signed `vN.md`.
   - **Comments on a draft**: revise the draft file directly (drafts are mutable and unsigned).
   - **General / tracker / timeline / review comments**: answer or act as appropriate.
   - **Log the exchange.** Every submitted feedback produces decision-log entries (real timestamps via `date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"`, standard Context / Question / Response / Effect format; board feedback is the Context, the researcher's comment or decision is the Response). This includes feedback the researcher reviews and declines — one entry recording that it was reviewed, no changes accepted, and why.
   - **After routing completes, delete `plans/.board-feedback.md`** if it still exists.

6. **Close the loop.** Offer to reopen the board to see the updated state. If artifacts changed, suggest a commit (do not run it without approval).

7. **Export mode.** Run `python3 <script> --export`. Then state the privacy reminder in publishing terms: committing or sharing `plans/board.html` IS publishing everything under `plans/` verbatim — treat it exactly like publishing the plans themselves (participant details and IRB specifics stay out, or export to a non-committed path instead). Suggest a commit such as `plans: export board snapshot`.

8. **Share mode.** Resolve any named component to its `NN-slug`, then run `python3 <script> --share [--focus NN-slug]`. Report the output path and state the privacy reminder in publishing terms: emailing this file IS publishing its embedded plan content to that person — an unfocused share embeds everything under `plans/`; a focused share embeds that component's plans plus the full master plan (always visible by design). Practical notes for the researcher: some mail providers flag `.html` attachments — zip the file or use a Dropbox/Drive link if delivery fails; the collaborator needs only a browser, and sends back a `board-feedback-*.txt` file.

9. **Ingest mode.** Run `python3 <script> --collect <file>`. If stderr contains a `STALE` line, relay it to the researcher before routing anything — never route stale feedback silently; signed versions are immutable so anchors on a signed vN still resolve, but drafts may have moved on. Then route the printed document through step 5 unchanged, with one addition: when the JSON fence has `"mode": "remote"`, attribute decision-log entries as "Board feedback from <reviewer> (remote)" using the fence's `reviewer` field; never add "(remote)" otherwise. Multiple files route one at a time, in the order the researcher chooses. The source file is never deleted by the script; leave it where it is.
