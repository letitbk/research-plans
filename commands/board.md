Open the project board, or export a shareable snapshot. Skill context: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/SKILL.md`. The board script is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/scripts/board.py`; it needs only python3.

1. **Gate.** Requires `plans/master-plan.md` with its marker; if absent, say so and suggest `/research-plans:init`. Stop.

2. **Recover pending feedback first.** If `plans/.board-feedback.md` exists, a previous board session was interrupted before its feedback was routed. Run `python3 <script> --collect`, route what it prints (step 5), and only then consider opening a new board.

3. **Resolve the mode.** If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--export`, go to step 7. If it contains `--share`, go to step 8. If it contains `--collect` with a file path, go to step 9. If it names a component (name or number), resolve it to its `NN-slug` from the master plan for `--focus`. A `NN-slug:rN` argument (from /research-plans:results) passes through to `--focus` verbatim — it opens the board directly on that results bundle.

4. **Serve.** Run exactly:
   `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/scripts/board.py [--focus NN-slug]`
   **in the background** if the harness supports background bash (completion re-invokes you with its output); otherwise run it in the foreground with a 10-minute timeout. Tell the researcher: the board is open in their browser; annotate, then press "Send to Claude". Handle the exit:
   - **exit 0** — the feedback document is on stdout; go to step 5.
   - **exit 2** (timed out, no feedback) — tell the researcher to finish annotating and run `/research-plans:board` again; step 2 will recover their submission via the pending file.
   - **exit 130** (cancelled) — stop quietly.
   - **exit 1 with "another board is open"** — relay the message; the researcher closes the other board or asks you to re-run with `--force`.
   - If the bash call itself timed out or its output is lost, run `--collect` to retrieve the feedback.

5. **Route the feedback.** Parse the ```json board-feedback``` fence in the document (fall back to the markdown if the fence is missing or corrupt). Then:
   - **Anchored comments on a signed vN**: discuss each with the researcher. If they approve changes, write or refine `plans/execution/<NN-slug>/.draft-v<N+1>.md` — resume an existing draft rather than overwriting it; copy the current version, apply the changes, add the `Supersedes: vN — <reason>` line. Before each fresh review round, snapshot the current draft to the next `plans/execution/<NN-slug>/v<N+1>-draft-<K>.md` (next unused K, never overwritten) — committed, read-only iteration history. Offer the board again so they can review the vN↔draft diff. Only on their sign-off write `v<N+1>.md` (overwrite guard: next unused number), add the sign-off line, and delete only the ephemeral `.draft-v<N+1>.md` (keep the `v<N+1>-draft-*.md` snapshots). Never edit a signed `vN.md`.
   - **Comments on the working draft** (`.draft-vN.md`): revise it directly (it is mutable and unsigned). Committed draft iterations (`vN-draft-K.md`) are read-only history — the board does not accept comments on them.
   - **Tracker comments** (`[Tracker — row 3: …]`, `[Tracker — Project context]`): anchored to the master plan's rendered view; these may lead to master-plan edits (status, Outcome/notes, Serves, context) under the normal tracker rules.
   - **Timeline comments** (`[Timeline — Decision 2026-07-06 16:24]`): when they target a decision-log entry, NEVER rewrite the entry — the log is append-only. Discuss with the researcher; if the exchange changes scope or course, append a new entry. Synthetic cards (plan/results/verdict events) follow the rules of the artifact they reference.
   - **Review comments** (`[Reviews — item G3: …]`): saved reviews are records of a past review — never edit them. Comments feed a discussion, a re-run of /research-plans:review, or a plan revision.
   - **General view comments**: answer or act as appropriate.
   - **Verdict block** (`## VERDICT: ...` in the markdown; `verdict` object in the fence): apply it via `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/managing-research-plans/scripts/results.py verdict --component <c> --version <N> --status <s> --reviewer "<git user.name>" [--comment "..."] --plan-version <latest signed vN>`. Then: on **accepted**, update the component's tracker status to `done (verified)`; on **changes-requested**, treat the accompanying result/script comments as revision instructions — fix the scripts, re-run the analysis, and capture the fix as a NEW bundle via /research-plans:results (trigger `redo-after-review`). Either way, append a decision-log entry recording the verdict.
   - **Result comments** (`[<component> rN — artifact/metric/report]`) and **script comments** (`[... lines A-B]`): these reference immutable bundle contents — never edit the bundle. Discuss with the researcher; fixes flow into scripts in the working tree and a new capture.
   - **Log the exchange.** Every submitted feedback produces decision-log entries (real timestamps via `date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"`, standard Context / Question / Response / Effect format; board feedback is the Context, the researcher's comment or decision is the Response). This includes feedback the researcher reviews and declines — one entry recording that it was reviewed, no changes accepted, and why.
   - **After routing completes, delete `plans/.board-feedback.md`** if it still exists.

6. **Close the loop.** Offer to reopen the board to see the updated state. If artifacts changed, suggest a commit (do not run it without approval).

7. **Export mode.** Run `python3 <script> --export`. Then state the privacy reminder in publishing terms: committing or sharing `plans/board.html` IS publishing everything under `plans/` verbatim — treat it exactly like publishing the plans themselves (participant details and IRB specifics stay out, or export to a non-committed path instead). Suggest a commit such as `plans: export board snapshot`.

8. **Share mode.** Resolve any named component to its `NN-slug`, then run `python3 <script> --share [--focus NN-slug]`. Report the output path and state the privacy reminder in publishing terms: emailing this file IS publishing its embedded plan content to that person — an unfocused share embeds everything under `plans/`; a focused share embeds that component's plans plus the full master plan (always visible by design). Practical notes for the researcher: some mail providers flag `.html` attachments — zip the file or use a Dropbox/Drive link if delivery fails; the collaborator needs only a browser, and sends back a `board-feedback-*.txt` file.

9. **Ingest mode.** Run `python3 <script> --collect <file>`. If stderr contains a `STALE` line, relay it to the researcher before routing anything — never route stale feedback silently; signed versions are immutable so anchors on a signed vN still resolve, but drafts may have moved on. Then route the printed document through step 5 unchanged, with one addition: when the JSON fence has `"mode": "remote"`, attribute decision-log entries as "Board feedback from <reviewer> (remote)" using the fence's `reviewer` field; never add "(remote)" otherwise. Multiple files route one at a time, in the order the researcher chooses. The source file is never deleted by the script; leave it where it is.
