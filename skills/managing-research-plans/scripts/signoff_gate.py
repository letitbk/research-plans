"""research-plans sign-off gate (PreToolUse hook for Write|Edit).

Blocks the write of a signed plan version (plans/execution/<slug>/vN.md in an
initialized project) until the researcher approves it on the board in their
browser. Also mechanically enforces version immutability (no edits to, or
overwrites of, an existing vN.md).

Contract: ALL decisions are exit 0 + PreToolUse decision JSON on stdout.
Exit 0 with no output = not gated (normal permission flow).
Escape hatch: RESEARCH_PLANS_NO_GATE=1. Wait ceiling: RESEARCH_PLANS_GATE_TIMEOUT
(seconds, clamped to [30, 1500]; default 1500 — always below the 1800s hook
timeout in hooks.json, because timeout-exceeded hook behavior is undocumented).

Stdlib only, Python 3.9+.
