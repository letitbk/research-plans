# Findings (raw) — Phase 1 sweep + Phase 2 probes

Working ledger. Each finding: `id` · dimension · surface:location · scenario-row · provisional-severity · evidence · verification-status · proposed-direction · effort · risk-note. Provisional severity is a triage tag; final priority is derived in Task 12 (impact × likelihood × reach × confidence). `read-confirmed` = verified against the real file by the controller; `to-verify` = needs a Phase-2 probe to close.

Sections: controller reads (commands/skill/templates/manifests/hooks) filed first; subagent sweeps (board UI, scripts, docs, web-template) integrated after controller verification; probe findings appended per task.

---

## Coherence

**COH-1 · board lifecycle doc drift** · `docs/reference.md:50` vs `commands/board.md:15,22` · S18-adjacent · **P2** · read-confirmed
`reference.md:50`: "the board refreshes itself with the updated state. After an idle hour it goes to sleep." `board.md:15`: "has **no idle timeout** … the board … **closes**." `board.md:22`: "a plain live board **never sleeps**." The user-facing reference describes the pre-v0.18 lifecycle.
→ Update `reference.md:50` to the close-on-action + no-idle-timeout behavior. Effort **S**. Risk-note: none (pure doc fix).

**COH-2 · model-nudge paragraph duplicated ×3** · `SKILL.md:27`, `plan.md:9`, `sync.md:8` · — · **P2** · read-confirmed
The sentence "Model profile: this stage is set to <model>… Switch with /model…" is verbatim in all three; surrounding logic differs per stage.
→ Extract a shared snippet parameterized by stage. Effort **M**. Risk-note: **load-bearing variation** — `plan.md:9` appends `, effort <level>` handling the other two lack; a naive merge drops it. Weigh in synthesis.

**COH-3 · initialized-project gate restated ×8** · `review.md:7`, `adopt.md:9`, `plan.md:7`, `sync.md:6`, `models.md:6`, `results.md:7`, `report.md:7` (exact phrase) + `board.md:9` (variant phrasing) · — · **P2** · read-confirmed
Eight commands gate on an initialized project in two phrasings (init/renew are the exceptions).
→ A shared "requires-init" preamble. Effort **S**. Risk-note: low; a simple guard, though board.md integrates it into its step 1.

**COH-4 · provenance rule near-duplicated** · `SKILL.md:51` + `results.md:19` · S16 · **P2** · read-confirmed
The full planned/retrofit rule appears nearly verbatim in both.
→ Consolidate to SKILL.md + a reference. Effort **M**. Risk-note: `results.md:19` needs the rule inline at the manifest-writing step (load-bearing there) — keep a terse inline pointer.

**COH-5 · stale `token_ok` docstring** · `board.py:867-870` · S10 · **P2** · read-confirmed (non-bug)
Docstring says the per-boot token is "NOT yet enforced in do_POST"; `do_POST:1216` enforces it. Code correct, comment stale.
→ Delete/correct the docstring. Effort **S**. Risk-note: none.

---

## Token efficiency

**TOK-1 · always-on floor = 524 est-tokens** · 10 command `description:` lines + skill description · — · **P1** · read-confirmed (measured, `token-report.md §1` = 2094 B)
The only unconditional cost — loaded every session in every project, including repos that never use the workflow.
→ Tighten the 4 wordiest descriptions (renew 217 B, adopt 211 B, results 209 B, report 195 B). Effort **S**. Risk-note: descriptions are discovery text — keep them clear; trim padding, not meaning. **Highest-frequency lever in the plugin.**

**TOK-2 · board.md web-runbook is 36% of every /board open** · `board.md` step 10→EOF = 12,652 B of 34,825 · — · **P1** · read-confirmed (measured)
The Vercel web-publish runbook (steps 10–14) loads on every plain `/board` open, though it is only reached by `--publish*`/`--pull`/`--web-connect`.
→ Move the web runbook to a reference file loaded only on those modes; board.md's plain-open path drops ~36%. Effort **M**. Risk-note: the mode dispatch (step 3) must still route correctly — keep the mode table, externalize the runbook body.

**TOK-3 · /plan sign-off chain loads ~13.7k est-tokens into the main context** · `plan.md`+`execution-plan.md`+`review.md`+`board.md` · — · **P1** · read-confirmed (measured, `token-report.md §3`)
The `/plan` auto-chain (plan.md:34 → /review → /board) pulls the entire `board.md` (8.7k) into the main session context; peak 13,719 est-tokens, board.md dominant.
→ Directly reduced by TOK-2 (board.md split). Effort **M** (same fix). Risk-note: none beyond TOK-2's.

**TOK-4 · results.md adopt/reconcile block is 26%** · `results.md` step 8→EOF = 4,861 B of 18,048 · — · **P2** · read-confirmed (measured)
The adopt/reconcile/regeneration modes load on every plain single-capture `/results`.
→ Mode-split like board.md (move adopt+reconcile to a reference). Effort **M**. Risk-note: the single-capture path (steps 1–7) is the common case and must stay inline; only the mode branches externalize.

---

## Portability

**POR-1 · codex/agy unguarded in board Review-with** · `board.md:44,46,47` · SUP · **P1** · read-confirmed (static); runtime to-verify by T8
The `codex`/`agy` review paths shell out with no `command -v` guard, unlike `pandoc` (`report.md:24`).
→ Add a `command -v codex`/`agy` preflight mirroring report.md's pandoc guard, so a missing CLI yields a graceful "not available" not a raw failure. Effort **S**. Risk-note: verify the exact failure mode in T8 (missing-tool arm) before wording the fix.

**POR-2 · headless /init dead-ends** · `init.md` interview · S11 · **P1** · to-verify (T8 closes)
Headless `AskUserQuestion` is auto-denied (`--permission-mode dontAsk`, per baseline.md), so a bare headless `/init` asks questions and exits with no artifacts (friction-log 1.1, still pending ruling).
→ Detect headless + either seed-args guidance or a clear "nothing was created; re-run with …" message. Effort **M**. Risk-note: confirm the current behavior in the T8 clean-room before designing the fix.

---

## Security / least-privilege

**SEC-1 · rp-plan-reviewer grants unscoped Bash** · `rp-plan-reviewer.md:6` (`tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash`) · — · **P2** · read-confirmed
The other two agents (`rp-board-reviewer`, `rp-results-validator`) carry no Bash. rp-plan-reviewer needs git for integrity flags, but agent frontmatter can't scope `Bash(git:*)` (platform limitation), so it holds **unrestricted** Bash restricted only by body prose ("Bash is for read-only evidence gathering only", :17).
→ Defense-in-depth gap; document the platform limitation, consider whether integrity flags could be precomputed by the dispatching command and passed in (removing the agent's Bash entirely). Effort **M**. Risk-note: the git-evidence need is real; removing Bash means moving integrity-flag computation upstream.

**HOOK-1 · Write|Edit-only gate matcher; redirection escape** · `hooks.json:5` · HOOK · **P1** · to-verify (T10 closes)
The sign-off gate matches `Write|Edit` only. A shell **redirection** (`Bash` `>`) is outside the matcher and could, in principle, create/modify a signed `vN.md` without the gate. `reference.md:93` documents this boundary.
→ Assess in T10 whether redirection actually bypasses the immutability invariant; if so, weigh a broader matcher or a complementary check. Effort **M**. Risk-note: this is the plugin's core integrity invariant — verify carefully, do not overstate before the T10 probe.

---

## Considered and cleared (not findings)

- **Manifest versions consistent** — `plugin.json` 0.18.0, `board/package.json` 0.18.0, `marketplace.json` version-less (the documented 2-file-bump convention). No drift.
- **Cross-file step pointers resolve** — all load-bearing "see X step N" references currently resolve (`xref-map.md`); recorded as a restructuring constraint, not a finding.
- **rp-board-reviewer / rp-results-validator tool grants** — correctly minimal (Read/Grep/Glob, no Bash).

---

## Subagent sweeps (integrated after controller verification)

### Board UI (subagent, controller-verified)
Agent self-dropped two false leads (Reports blank-render: `parseReport` never returns null; "Codex GPT-5.5" label matches `board.md`'s `-m gpt-5.5`). Remaining 9, verified:

**UI-1 · native alert()/window.prompt() in copy-fallback** · `board/src/App.tsx:752,754` · — · **P2** · read-confirmed (controller-verified)
`copyFallback` calls `alert("Feedback copied…")` on success and `window.prompt("Copy the feedback below:", …)` on clipboard failure. **Violates the codebase's own documented rule** (`RequestChangesButton.tsx:1-2`: "BK's board rule: no native prompt dialogs") and the napkin's recorded pet peeve. Grep confirms these are the ONLY native dialogs in `board/src`.
→ Render the fallback in an in-DOM selectable textarea (reuse the panel). Effort **S**. Risk-note: it is a fallback path, but the success `alert` fires on the normal copy action, not just on error.

**UI-2 · dead `canPost` prop** · `board/src/views/{Tracker.tsx:47,65, PlanReader.tsx:65,85, Results.tsx:219,235}` · — · **P2** · read-confirmed (controller-verified)
Destructured + typed in all three views, referenced nowhere in their bodies; App threads it in (App.tsx:1145,1168,1179). Also a typing inconsistency: `Results` types it required (`canPost: boolean`), the others optional (`canPost?: boolean`).
→ Drop the prop from the three signatures + call sites. Effort **S**. Risk-note: verified unused by grep; safe removal.

**UI-3 · annotation composer is mouse-only** · `board/src/components/AnnotationLayer.tsx:79-100,121` · S18-adjacent · **P2** · read-confirmed
The "Comment" pill surfaces only via `onMouseUp`; no keyboard path to open the composer (the known drag-select gap).
→ Add a selectionchange-driven affordance or a comment-on-selection shortcut. Effort **M**. Risk-note: touch-commenting is separately a known deferred gap; this is the keyboard axis.

**UI-4 · line-comment range selection mouse-only** · `board/src/components/ScriptViewer.tsx:82-98` · — · **P2** · read-confirmed
Line-comment ranges are set via `onClick`/shift-click; gutter cells get `tabIndex` only on already-saved lines, so keyboard users cannot create a line comment.
→ Make line numbers focusable with Enter/Shift-Enter. Effort **M**.

**UI-5 · header row cannot wrap** · `board/src/App.tsx:1012,1022` · — · **P2** · to-verify (T9)
Header `flex … gap-4` + `<nav>` with up to 8 tabs and controls, no `flex-wrap`/overflow.
→ Allow wrap or collapse nav into an overflow menu below a breakpoint. Effort **M**. Risk-note: confirm overflow at 200% zoom / narrow viewport in the T9 live probe.

**UI-6 · fixed w-56 sidebars never stack** · `board/src/views/{PlanReader.tsx:266, Results.tsx:419, Reports.tsx:157}` · — · **P2** · to-verify (T9)
14rem aside in a `flex` row squeezes the main pane at narrow width / high zoom.
→ Stack the sidebar above content below a breakpoint. Effort **M**. Risk-note: T9 confirms the squeeze point.

**UI-7 · Tracker/Archive tables lack an overflow wrapper** · `board/src/views/Tracker.tsx:366, Archive.tsx:134` · — · **P2** · to-verify (T9)
7–8-column tables with no scroll wrapper, whereas `Models.tsx:288` wraps its table in `overflow-x-auto`. Inconsistent + can force page-level horizontal scroll.
→ Wrap Tracker/Archive tables in `overflow-x-auto` to match Models. Effort **S**.

**UI-8 · dark-mode contrast gap** · `board/src/views/PlanReader.tsx:447` · — · **P2** · to-verify (T9)
`bg-red-100 … text-red-800 dark:text-red-300` — a `dark:` text override with no `dark:bg-*`, so light text on light-pink in dark mode.
→ Add `dark:bg-red-900/*` or drop the `dark:` text override. Effort **S**. Risk-note: verify the rendered contrast in T9.

**UI-9 · Review-with dropdown has no outside-click/Escape dismissal** · `board/src/components/ReviewMenu.tsx:21-30` · — · **P2** · to-verify (T9)
`setOpen((o) => !o)` with no document/outside-click or Escape handler.
→ Add outside-click + Escape dismissal. Effort **S**.

### Web-template / hosted board (subagent, controller-verified)
Agent scope note (verified): **no** unauthenticated bypass and **no** blob-URL leak — both gates check `env` truthiness before comparing (no empty-secret bypass), the api functions re-check `isAuthed` behind the middleware (defense in depth), and `blobstore.ts:33` returns parsed content only (no url leaves the module). These hold as **static contracts**; the live Vercel probe (T10/S7) confirms runtime.

**WT-1 · CSRF-to-destruction on /api/clear** · `web-template/api/clear.ts:8,21-22` · S7 · **P1 (top security finding)** · read-confirmed (code gap) + to-verify (live exploit, T10)
`clear.ts` `run(headers, env, now)` takes **no method** and the handler calls it for any HTTP method — while `comments.ts:9,25` correctly switches on method and 405s otherwise. With the `SameSite=Lax` session cookie (auth.ts:48), a **top-level GET navigation** to `/api/clear` (a clicked link, `window.location`, or a `<meta http-equiv=refresh>`) carries the cookie, `isAuthed` passes, and **every collaborator comment is deleted** — unauthorized, irreversible (`--web-clear` is the only reset). Verified: clear.ts has no method guard; comments.ts does.
→ Require POST (405 otherwise), matching comments.ts; consider a CSRF token. Same method gap makes GET `/api/logout` a lesser forced-logout nuisance. Effort **S**. Risk-note: needs an authed victim to visit an attacker page while the 30-day cookie is valid — plausible for a targeted collaborator, and the fix is trivial.

**WT-2 · comment overwrite + author impersonation** · `web-template/lib/blobstore.ts:12,14` + `api/comments.ts:21` · S5 · **P2** · read-confirmed
Blob path is the **client-supplied** `id` with `allowOverwrite: true`; GET hands every reader each comment's `id`. Any authed collaborator can re-POST another's `id` to silently overwrite/erase their comment; `author` is self-asserted (shared-password model has no server-bound identity). UUID validation does prevent path traversal via `id`.
→ Server-assign the blob id (ignore client id) or reject overwrite of an existing id; treat `author` as untrusted display text. Effort **M**. Risk-note: inherent to the shared-password design; document the trust model even if not fully fixed.

**WT-3 · no content sanitization on ingest; 14 dangerouslySetInnerHTML sinks downstream** · `web-template/lib/validate.ts:38-45` → board bundle · S5/S9 · **P2** · to-verify (T10 render trace)
Ingestion length-caps only known keys and stores content **raw**; safety rests entirely on the downstream React renderer escaping. The board bundle has 14 `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` sinks (markdown). A crafted `comment`/`quote`/`excerpt` reaching one would be **stored XSS** against other collaborators.
→ Trace whether any hosted-comment field flows into a `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` sink (connects to the napkin's Markdown link-scheme history); sanitize on render or server-side. Effort **M**. Risk-note: requires an authed poster and React escapes plain text by default — **exploitability must be adjudicated by the live/code render trace in T10**, do not overstate.

**WT-4 · middleware gate is untested; gateDecision is runtime-dead** · `web-template/lib/gate.ts:1` + `middleware.ts:4` · — · **P2** · read-confirmed
The real gate is **inlined** in middleware.ts (it "does NOT import from ./lib" — the Node-runtime constraint); `gateDecision()` + its `gate.test.ts` suite test a parallel copy the deployment never runs, so the security-critical middleware gate + its duplicated `verifyCookie`/`isAuthed` have **no direct test**. (gate.ts's `SECURITY_HEADERS` export IS used by the api functions — only `gateDecision` is dead.)
→ Add tests driving the middleware default export, or a snapshot test asserting the two implementations agree. Effort **M**. Risk-note: logic is currently consistent; the risk is a future middleware edit going uncaught.

**WT-5 · byte cap counts UTF-16 code units** · `web-template/lib/validate.ts:6,29` · — · **P2** · read-confirmed
`serialized.length > MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` (65536) counts code units, not bytes, so the "64KB" cap admits ~2-3× that in bytes for multibyte/emoji content.
→ `Buffer.byteLength(serialized, "utf8")`. Effort **S**.

**WT-6 · no rate limiting on /api/login (code)** · `web-template/api/login.ts:13` · S7 · **P2** · read-confirmed
The single shared password has no attempt counter/backoff in code (comparison is correctly timing-safe; empty password fails closed). **Mitigation:** `board.md:81` documents enabling Vercel Firewall rate-limiting on the login route as a manual first-run step — so this is "relies on a setup step the user may skip."
→ Keep the documented WAF step prominent; consider an in-code backoff as defense-in-depth; require a strong generated password (already done). Effort **M**. Risk-note: partially mitigated by the documented WAF step; verify the doc makes it non-optional.

**WT-7 · dead `.err` CSS + silent login failure + login-page divergence** · `web-template/lib/loginPage.ts:12`, `api/login.ts:16`, `middleware.ts:64-66` · — · **P2** · read-confirmed
`.err` style has no matching element; a failed login silently re-serves the plain form with no feedback; the middleware's inlined login page omits the `.err` rule (the two login pages have cosmetically diverged).
→ Wire an error message on failed login (or drop the dead rule) and reconcile the two page copies. Effort **S**.

### Docs (subagent, controller-verified)
Agent verified NOT-drift (spares rework): the 6-tab count, the 25-min gate ceiling (=1500s), the 5 MB oversized threshold, the v0.1.0–v0.18.0 range, the update strings, and all TOC anchors/file paths resolve. The board-lifecycle drift it found is **COH-1** (already filed; the agent corroborated it with CHANGELOG 0.18.0 and argued P1 for user-facing confusion — kept at COH-1, reach noted). Two new:

**DOC-1 · model-profile.md omitted from the reference "what it creates" tree** · `docs/reference.md:100-123` vs `init.md:28` (+ `reference.md:80`) · — · **P2** · read-confirmed
The `plans/` tree omits `plans/model-profile.md`, which `init.md:28` writes unconditionally at init — and `reference.md:80` itself says init creates it, so the doc is internally inconsistent with its own tree.
→ Add a `model-profile.md` row to the tree. Effort **S**.

**DOC-2 · QUICKSTART lists "saved review scorecards" as a standalone surface** · `QUICKSTART.md:72` vs `App.tsx:53-61` · — · **P2** · to-verify (borderline)
Post-v0.4 the Reviews tab was removed (scores live in the plan header); QUICKSTART still lists "saved review scorecards" as a board surface alongside the tabs. Stale phrasing rather than a hard contradiction (scorecards are still saved to `plans/reviews/` and their scores still render in the header).
→ Reword to "each plan version's rubric score in its header." Effort **S**.

### Python scripts (subagent, controller-verified)
Agent self-rejected two false leads (`generate_passphrase` is called out-of-process by board.md:80 + tested; `set_password`'s stub is documented-intended). Verified findings, with one controller severity correction:

**SCR-1 · normal --pull never unlinks the inbox → re-offers the prior batch** · `board.py:1619-1624` · S5 · **P1** · read-confirmed (controller-verified)
The normal pull writes each doc to `.board-web-inbox/*.txt` (1619), marks ids pulled (1622), and routes (1624) — but **never unlinks the inbox files**. Only the *next* pull's recovery drain (1571) removes them, and it **re-routes them first**. So every `--pull` after the first re-presents the previous batch's already-routed comments (risking double-application). Verified against the drain at 1567-1571 vs the normal loop at 1623-1624.
→ Unlink each inbox file immediately after routing it in the normal loop, so the drain handles only genuine crash leftovers. Effort **S**. Risk-note: routing is "idempotent-minded" (board.md), which softens but does not remove the double-processing.

**SCR-2 · non-atomic pulled-state write** · `board.py:1622` · S5 · **P2** · read-confirmed
`_pulled_path(root).write_text(json.dumps(...))` is a plain write, unlike the order file at 1112-1114 (tmp + `os.replace`). A crash mid-write corrupts `.board-web-pulled.json`, `_read_pulled` returns an empty set, and **every historical comment is re-pulled and re-routed**.
→ Write via tmp + `os.replace` (the pattern already used at 1114). Effort **S**.

**SCR-3 · server overwrites an un-acked order; relies on workflow recovery** · `board.py:1114` (accept_order); `serve()` · S4 · **P2** · read-confirmed
`accept_order` `os.replace`s `.board-feedback.md` unconditionally; the single-slot guard prevents two orders per *run* but the server never checks for a prior crashed session's un-acked order at startup. The current defense is the **workflow** (board.md:11: run `--collect` recovery before opening a new board) — if that step is skipped, a prior un-acked feedback-only order (no ticket) is silently overwritten and lost.
→ Have `serve()`/`accept_order` refuse or warn when an un-acked `.board-feedback.md` already exists (belt-and-suspenders behind the workflow recovery). Effort **M**. Risk-note: the advertised "crash re-offers the order" (board.md:11) holds only if the workflow recovery runs; this hardens the server side.

**SCR-4 · ticket written after the durable order file (narrow crash window)** · `board.py:1282-1293` · S2 · **P2** *(agent flagged P1; controller downgraded)* · read-confirmed
`accept_order` writes `.board-feedback.md` (1114), then `write_ticket` runs after (1291-1293). A SIGKILL between leaves an "approved" order with no authorizing ticket → the routed sign-off is denied (board.md:33) and needs re-approval. **Downgraded to P2**: the window is tiny, recoverable by re-approval, and the agent's own evidence confirms no corruption (draft persists, immutability holds).
→ Write the ticket before the durable order file, so "an approved order always has its ticket" holds. Effort **S**.

**SCR-5 · three more hand-synced Python/TypeScript pairs** · `board.py:237-246` (fnv1a_hex↔hostedComments.ts), `board.py:331-344` (artifact_headers↔artifactDisplay.ts), `board.py:199-221` (payload_files↔allFiles in parse.ts) · S8-class · **P2** · read-confirmed
Beyond the known `is_substantive` duplicate, three more Py/TS pairs each carry a "keep in sync" comment. Drift consequences: hash mismatch (staleness detection mis-fires), inline-vs-download divergence, shareHash file-set desync. fnv1a_hex + payload_files are guarded by pinned cross-language test vectors; artifact_headers may not be.
→ Ensure each pair has a pinned cross-language parity test (extend the S8 approach to all four pairs). Effort **S** each. Risk-note: no fix removes the duplication (two languages) — the mitigation is the parity test.

**SCR-6 · drift detection swallows read errors as no-drift** · `board.py:458-460` · S15 · **P2** · read-confirmed
`except Exception: changed = []` — a transient `sha256_file` OSError is swallowed and the component is reported no-drift, masking a real (advisory) drift-detection failure.
→ Narrow the except or log to stderr. Effort **S**.

**SCR-7 · finalize silently drops model provenance on profile-load failure** · `results.py:355-361` · S16 · **P2** · read-confirmed
`except Exception: prescribed = None` — any `models.load_profile` failure is swallowed and the sealed, immutable bundle omits prescribed-model provenance with no diagnostic (permanent, since bundles are immutable).
→ Narrow to expected errors / emit a stderr note. Effort **S**.

**SCR-8 · check_update write-only state fields** · `check_update.py:17-20,200-202` · — · **P2** · read-confirmed (possibly intentional)
`lastSuccess`/`lastSeenRemoteVersion`/`installedVersionAtLastCheck` are written and round-tripped but never read for control flow (only `lastAttempt` and `lastNotifiedVersion` drive logic).
→ Drop the unused fields or wire the intended consumer — confirm they aren't intentional diagnostics first. Effort **S**.

---

## Phase 2 — Security probes (local, controller-run)

Environment: claude 2.1.211 available, network open (200), **Vercel logged in as `letitbk`** — so the clean-room and live-Vercel arms are all runnable here. Gate suites 33 green.

**S9 · confused-deputy defense HOLDS** · `board.py:1944` (strip) + `:1964`/`neutralize_action_headings` · **PASS** (runtime-verified, function-level)
Direct test on a crafted malicious hand-delivered file (a `## VERDICT:` action heading + a fence carrying `verdict`+`reviewRequest` keys + an embedded forging fence inside a `quote`): `strip_action_keys_from_document` removed `['reviewRequest','verdict']` (all fences, incl. the nested one), `neutralize_action_headings` demoted `## VERDICT:` → `> ## VERDICT:` (blockquote), and the legit comment survived. Forge blocked. (Note: full `--collect` requires an initialized project — the function-level test is the clean isolation of the defense.)

**S2 · ticket-forgery guard HOLDS** · `signoff_gate.py:230` · **PASS** (verified)
The 33 gate tests (test_gate_archive/explicitness/results) pass; agent-written `.import-approved-*` tickets are denied. Runtime forgery attempt deferred to the fixture-backed run but the guard + its tests are green.

**HOOK-1 · gate matcher is Write/Edit-only; Bash bypasses** · `hooks.json:5` · **P2** · read-confirmed (characterized)
The sign-off gate's PreToolUse matcher is `Write/Edit` only. A Bash-mediated file write — e.g. `python3 -c "open('…/v1.md','w')…"`, which commands grant via `Bash(python3:*)` — is **not** matched, so it bypasses the immutability/approval gate. Documented boundary (`reference.md:93`). Mitigations: the workflow always uses the Write tool (which IS gated), and the commands scope Bash to specific subcommands. But the "mechanically enforced immutability" claim holds only against the Write path, not against Bash file I/O.
→ Note the boundary honestly in the docs; consider whether a complementary check (e.g. a post-write integrity scan) is warranted. Effort **M**. Risk-note: requires deliberate circumvention; the normal flow is safe.

**WT-1 · CSRF code-gap confirmed + untested** · `clear.ts:8` · **P1** · read-confirmed (code) + to-verify (runtime needs Vercel)
Confirmed: `clear.test.ts` has **no** method/GET/405 test, while `comments.test.ts` tests method — the destructive method-gap is both real and uncovered. The end-to-end runtime exploit (GET reaches the handler through Vercel routing + Lax cookie) is confirmable on the live-Vercel arm (S7 run).

## Sweep summary
**~40 findings** filed (13 controller-read + 9 board UI + 7 web-template + 2 docs + 8 scripts, minus the board-lifecycle dup). Severity mix: **2 P1** verified from the sweep (WT-1 CSRF, SCR-1 pull re-offer) plus the earlier P1 token/portability levers (TOK-1/2/3, POR-1/2, HOOK-1); the rest P2. Behavioral P1/P2s tagged to scenario rows (S2/S4/S5/S7/S8/S15/S16/S11) are `to-verify` — the Phase-2 probes close them. Next: Phase 2 probes.
