# Immigration Attitudes (ISSP) — Master Plan

Last updated: 2026-07-02
Initialized: 2026-06-28 09:15

## Project context

This project is a cross-national analysis of immigration attitudes using ISSP data (${MARKER}). It asks how support for immigration varies across countries and what individual- and country-level factors account for that variation.

The hard constraint is the deadline: end of July 2026.

### Research questions

1. RQ1: How does public support for immigration vary across countries and over time?
2. RQ2: Which individual- and country-level factors are associated with that variation?

## Components

| # | Component | Status | Execution plan | Outcome / notes | Serves |

| 1 | Data acquisition | done | — | ISSP sample in repo | — |
| 2 | Data cleaning | done | [v2](execution/02-data-cleaning/v2.md) | 66,864 rows after exclusions | RQ1, RQ2 |
| 3 | Descriptive analysis | in progress | [v1](execution/03-descriptives/v1.md) | — | RQ1 |
| 4 | Regression modeling | not started | — | — | RQ2 |

Statuses: \`not started\` / \`planned\` / \`in progress\` / \`done\` / \`dropped\`.

Append-only. Entries are timestamped and written as decisions happen.

## 2026-07-01 10:12

**Context:** Starting data cleaning under plan v1.
**Question (Claude):** The codebook lists 97/98 as refusal codes for the support item. Treat as missing?
**Response (researcher):** Yes — recode to NA; add a count to the cleaning log.
**Effect on execution:** Added recode step; 431 rows affected.

## 2026-07-01 15:40

**Context:** Cleaning revealed duplicated household IDs in two countries.
**Decision (Claude):** Flagged rather than dropped — awaiting researcher call.
**Response (researcher):** Drop exact duplicates only; keep the rest.
**Effect on execution:** Plan revision proposed (v2) to record the exclusion rule.

## 2026-07-02 09:05 (late-captured at sync)

**Context:** Yesterday's session ended without logging the weighting decision.
**Question (Claude):** Use ISSP design weights in descriptives?
**Response (researcher):** Yes, weighted and unweighted side by side.
**Effect on execution:** Descriptives plan updated before execution.

const cleaningV1 = `# Data Cleaning — Execution Plan v1

Component: \`02-data-cleaning\` · Master plan: [master-plan.md](../../master-plan.md) · Date: 2026-06-30

## Context

Prepare the ISSP extract for analysis: recode missing values, harmonize country codes, and produce a documented analysis sample.

## Scope decisions

| Dimension | Decision | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Missing codes | Recode 97/98 to NA | Codebook lists them as refusals |
| Countries | Keep all 31 | Attrition handled at modeling stage |

## Approach

Load raw extract, apply recode table, write cleaned parquet + cleaning log.

## Build steps

1. Load raw CSV
2. Apply missing-value recodes
3. Write cleaned data + row-count log

## Verification

Row counts before/after each step logged; spot-check 20 random rows against raw.

## Out of scope

No imputation; no derived scales (descriptives component owns those).

Supersedes: v1 — duplicated household IDs discovered in two countries; added an explicit exclusion rule.

## Part 1 — For humans (the what & why)

## Goal and success criteria

Serves: RQ1, RQ2

Produce a documented analysis sample from the raw ISSP extract. Success: every recode and exclusion is logged with row counts; the cleaned file reproduces exactly from the committed script; the duplicate report is reviewed and signed off by the researcher.

## Context

Prepare the ISSP extract for analysis: recode missing values, harmonize country codes, and produce a documented analysis sample.

## Scope decisions

| Dimension | Decision | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Missing codes | Recode 97/98 to NA | Codebook lists them as refusals |
| Countries | Keep all 31 | Attrition handled at modeling stage |
| Duplicates | Drop exact duplicates only | Household IDs collide in two countries; partial matches kept |

## Part 2 — For agents (the how)

## Approach

Load raw extract, apply recode table, drop exact duplicates, write cleaned parquet + cleaning log.

## Build steps

1. Load raw CSV
2. Apply missing-value recodes
3. Drop exact duplicate rows (log counts per country)
4. Write cleaned data + row-count log

## Verification

Row counts before/after each step logged; spot-check 20 random rows against raw; duplicate report reviewed by researcher.

## Out of scope

No imputation; no derived scales (descriptives component owns those).

Meets the plan's success criteria: row count within the expected range, all

# Reconstructed History (pre-adoption)

Reconstructed at adoption on 2026-07-02; covers 2026-05 – 2026-07-02 12:00.

## 2026-05 — early dictionary + measurement pilots

**Evidence:** commits a1b2c3d..e4f5a6b; \`~/.claude/plans/measurement-pilot.md\`
**Decision / turn:** keyword-first measurement, LLM validation deferred to a later wave.
**Uncertain:** the exact date the v0.1 dictionary was abandoned.

## 2026-06 — cross-source frame assembled

**Evidence:** commit 7c8d9e0; \`docs/plans/cross-source.md\`
**Decision / turn:** LinkUp adopted as the primary levels source; CoreSignal kept for the causal panel.
